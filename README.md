# Solitude 🌙☀️

**An interactive portfolio built with React and Tailwind CSS!**  
This project showcases everything about me — both socially and professionally — in a fun, dynamic way. Explore the unique features and interact with the website to learn more about who I am!

## 🛠 Features

### 1. **Interactive Links**
- Access my GitHub, LinkedIn (including my resume), and LinkTree via the buttons at the bottom of the page. These links will give you deeper insights into my work and connections.

### 2. **Dynamic Scenery**
- The website’s theme adapts based on the time of day:
  - **Day Theme** (6 AM - 6 PM): A vibrant day theme with a sun that moves from left to right across the sky.
  - **Night Theme** (6 PM - 6 AM): A calm night theme featuring a moon that traces the same path as the sun.
- This time-based scenery provides a visual experience that mirrors real-world day/night cycles.

### 3. **Narrator with Humor**
- Meet the interactive **narrator** that offers amusing lines and fun facts about me. 
- The narrator’s messages refresh every 12 hours, keeping the dialogue fresh and entertaining!

## 📋 How to Interact

- You can interact with the narrator by clicking buttons to reveal new, quirky messages.
- Check back at different times of the day to see the theme and the messages change!
