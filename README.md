# Solitude

My fun, interactive, portfolio made with React and Tailwindcss! Everything there is to know about me, socially and professionally can pretty much be derived from this project alone. 

## Features

1) It includes links to my GitHub, my resume on LinkedIn, and my LinkTree, as indicated by the buttons at the bottom.
2) The scenery of the website changes based on the time of day. Past 6 AM and before 6 PM, a day theme will be presented to the user. A night theme will be presented otherwise. Depending on the time, a sun (during the day) and a moon (during the night) will change position and move from the left side to the right side of the screen.
3) I included a narrator that you can interact with that will display some funny lines and some funny facts about me! After all, I did write him. Messages do change every 12 hours.
